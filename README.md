# Particle-Simulator
A customizable particle simulator made in p5.js

This is the first time I used OOP other than as a gimmick or part of a tutorial. There is something mesmerizing about this simulator.

## About the Code:
I made this particle simulator customizable. This means that color, sideways or upwards speed, particle amount, the position of the particle as well as the gravity pulling them can be dynamically changed as desired. For example, if both vertical and horizontal speeds and gravity are set to zero, this creates a drawing board kind of effect where particles just stay motionless.

## What are These Files:
- index.js and style.css: Webpage configurated by Processing.
- p5.js and p5.sound.min.js: What makes Processing work.
- sketch.js: Main script that renders and updates everything.
- particle.js: Class that creates a single spherical particle.
- Particles.js: Class responsible for creating a list of particles that is able to remove excess particles to generate new ones.

## How to Use the Code:
- Just upload the documents to p5.js web editor.

*Or*

- Using LiveServer from VSCode, you can run index.html on your browser.

- Whatever works for you.
